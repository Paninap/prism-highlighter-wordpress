A minimal and modular Prism WordPress plugin with a "detached" option.

== Description ==

The "Prism Highlighter for WordPress" plugin was based on the following:

1. "Prism Syntax Highlighter for WordPress" by [nextgenthemes](https://github.com/nextgenthemes/prism "Prism Syntax Highlighter for WordPress")
2. "Prism Detached" by [apfelbox](https://github.com/apfelbox/Prism-Detached "Prism Detached")
3. "Prism" by [LeaVerou](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism/ "PrismJS")

This fork was made mainly for my personal use, however, is shared to everyone as per the license of the work this was based on.

** which requires `data-user`, `data-host`, `data-prompt`, and `data-output`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the plugin's admin/settings area?

There is none. This was by design because there is nothing to "admin" or "set"

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
